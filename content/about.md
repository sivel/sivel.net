IF YOU REALLY want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. (In case that was too subtle for you I am a big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye" target="_blank">The Catcher in the Rye</a> by J.D. Salinger)

In any case I am employed as a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Ansible by Red Hat, working in San Antonio, TX.

I spend the majority of my time writing Python, contributing to [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/) and drinking booze, although maybe not in that order.

With that out of the way enjoy this site.
