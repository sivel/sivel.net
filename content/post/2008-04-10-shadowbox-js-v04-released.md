The [Shadowbox JS][1] WordPress Plugin has been updated to version 0.4. New to this update is the ability to add class="hidden" to hide additonal links when creating an album or gallery and the ability to not include the javascript libraries in the header if you have a theme or other plugin that handles this. See the [Change Log][2] for changes. Enjoy!
