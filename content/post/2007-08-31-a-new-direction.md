For years now I have tried to maintain a web site and entice users to it. I have done this to some extent but I believe what bothers me the most is the fact that until now I have strictly limited my site to technical postings and howtos.

I believe what I really want to do with my site is post whatever the hell I want as well as the technical mumbo jumbo and make it more friendly to even those who don't care about [patching a Linux kernel][1].

So if some of you have noticed small changes in the site recently it is due to me making it more generalized in nature.

If some of you have noticed poor uptime recently that is no fault of mine. My hosting provider assures me that everything should be back to normal now but I am still tracking roughly at 95% uptime for the latter part of August. We will have to wait and see how September fairs.
