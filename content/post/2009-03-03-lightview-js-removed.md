title: Lightview JS Removed Due to Licensing
type: post
---

I was recently contacted by [Nick Stackenburg][1] in regards to my [Lightview JS][2] WordPress plugin. It seems as although the license stated that I was allowed to freely distribute the [Lightview][3] code, there was a per domain license involved as well. Since I am in conflict with his license I am removing the Lightview JS plugin completely from the [WordPress Plugin Repository][4] as all versions have contained the Lightview code.

For the users of my Lightview JS plugin I am recommending that you switch to either my [Shadowbox JS][5] plugin or to the [Lightview Plus][6] plugin written by [Thorsten Puzich][7]. Users switching to the Lightview Plus plugin should purchase the domain license from the [Lightview][3] project page.
