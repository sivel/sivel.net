I'll be attending the [LinuxWorld Expo][1] in San Francisco at the beginning of August. I'll be arriving mid way through the conference so that I can attend to my sons first birthday and celebrations.

I'll be attending the exhibit hall and keynote addresses on Wednesday and Thursday (Aug 6 + 7), as well as Ubucon and flying back out on Friday. To those reading this who will be out there for the conference, maybe we will run into each other.
