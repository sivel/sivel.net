Since my [announcement][1] on Twitter and my [interview][2] on [WPTavern][3], most of you likely know that I decided to cease development and support for several of my plugins. Part of the process of doing so is finding new homes for these plugins so that they can live on. Two more plugins have found their new home with [Travis Ballard][4], who many of you know from Twitter or IRC as ansimation or ansi.

The specific posts for each of these plugins are:

*   <http://www.travisballard.com/wordpress/dynamic-favorites-wordpress-plugin/>
*   <http://www.travisballard.com/wordpress/possibly-related-recent-posts-wordpress-plugin/>

Please head on over and check out Travis' [site][4] and his [announcement][5] of taking over the plugins. With that being said, good luck Travis and these plugins are now 100% yours.
