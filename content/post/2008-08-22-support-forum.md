For some time now I have been trying to manage support for my WordPress plugins in the comments here or via email. I have quickly found that it becomes unmanageable and the comments become overwhelming. 

To alleviate the pain of supporting my plugins via this manner I have added a support forum. All WordPress plugin support discussions should be entered at the new support forum. I have enabled comment moderation here now so that support discussions no longer make it into the comments. These instructions are provided in the comment field on all pages.

So if you here to ask a support question for a WordPress plugin please head over to <http://forum.sivel.net/>.

A link to the forum also appears in the navigation bar on the upper right of this site.
