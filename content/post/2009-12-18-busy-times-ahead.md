For those of you who follow me on [twitter][1] you likely already know that I am about to move half way across the country to take a new job. A few weeks ago I accepted a job with [Rackspace][2] and will be moving from [Boonsboro, MD][3], population 3,399, to [San Antonio, TX][4], population 1,351,305. I'm leaving for Texas on December 28 and have an expected move in date of December 31. Considering the time of year and the incredibly fast paced relocation I will be considerably less involved with [WordPress][5] and [freenode][6] until things start to settle down.

If you are in need of something just be patient, I'll try to get to everything by sometime in mid March. I have some exciting updates to a few WordPress plugins that I hope to be able to get out in a reasonable amount time, so keep an eye out.
