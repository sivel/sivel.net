So I'm bored...Bored of a lot of things. So to satisfy at least part of my boredom, I killed my CSS a few minutes ago. Of course I have a backup, and yes I did kill it on purpose. Maybe someday I will restore it. My boredom isn't driving me to rewrite my CSS, but destroying my CSS makes me smile, which seems to help. UPDATE: I just wrote a script to restore 10 lines of my css every 10 minutes. In about 11 hours the site should be back to normal. Perhaps I'll write a script that continually removes all of the lines and then restores them all, 10 lines at a time. Wouldn't that be interesting?
