title: Gallery Shortcode Style to Head WordPress Plugin Changing Ownership
type: post
---

For some time now I have been looking at my plugins and deciding which I wanted to discontinue, which to continue supporting and which I thought someone may be interested in taking over ownership of. One such plugin is the [Gallery Shortcode Style to Head][1] plugin which does a look ahead to determine if any posts that will be displayed require the CSS, normally inserted into the body of a post, associated with the [gallery] shortcode. If it determines that such a post will be displayed on the page it prints the CSS to the head of the document, allowing the page to validate as XHTML 1.0.

I had decided to discontinue this plugin, but was recently contacted by [Scott Bradford][2] offering a patch to the plugin. After some discussion, I convinced Scott into taking over ownership of the plugin. The new home of the plugin can be found at <http://www.scottbradford.us/software/gallery-shortcode-style-to-head/>.

I will be redirecting requests to my site for this plugin to Scott's site. So if you have any questions from this moment forward stop by and talk to Scott.
