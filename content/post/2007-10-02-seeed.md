Rewind to July 22nd, 2007. Yes I can still do that.

My wife and I missed our flight from Athens, Greece to Munich, Germany. Luckily enough we were put on a later flight but would have to spend the night in Munich. The following morning while eating breakfast and watching MTV I happened to see two videos for the band [Seeed][1]. From that day on I have loved this band and their music videos. I have to say that their music videos are some of the best I have ever seen. One in particular has remained my favorite music video of all time...Ding.

Forward to October 1st, 2007. Here we go again...

I was playing around on YouTube and found the video for Ding. See below:
