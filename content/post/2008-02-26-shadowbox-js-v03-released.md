The [Shadowbox JS][1] WordPress Plugin has been updated to version 0.3. I don't often update this quickly but I had some time and Michael J. I. Jackson has released version 1.0 final of Shadowbox.js which adds native Lightbox support and a [feature request][2] that I asked for. See the [Change Log][3] for changes. Enjoy!
