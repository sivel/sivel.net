It has been quite some time since I have posted anything...Not due to the fact that I don't have anything to post but rather because I am busy preparing for my soon to come son and have been quite busy with work. With that being said I have placed a "what is my ip" page on my site. It's nothing special, but that is what makes it special. In my case I hate using the other "what is my ip" sites because they have so much extra crap on the page that I don't care about like ads (Odd that I hate ads and I work for the largest internet advertising company).

With the being said...the url: <http://sivel.net/ip>

Enjoy!

By the way...more postings to come soon!
