Over the next 2 months (or thereabout), expect things to not always work exactly as they may now on my site.  Some things unrelated to the actual install of WordPress on my site may be unavailable during this time.  I don't think anyone other than myself uses them, so I think everything should mostly go unnoticed.

I'm going to be performing some shuffling, and hope to keep it as minimally impacting as possible.

If you spot something strange, give me a shout!
