Today I am releasing updated versions of my [Page Restrict][1], [Lightview JS][2] and [Shadowbox JS][3] WordPress plugins.

New to the [Page Restrict][4] plugin is moving the content required for the admin pages into another file and including it only when in the admin portion of your site so that it isn't even loaded into memory during normal site views.

New to the [Lightview JS][5] plugin is support for the [ gallery] shortcode.

New to the [Shadowbox JS][6] plugin is support for the [ gallery] shortcode.

Enjoy!
