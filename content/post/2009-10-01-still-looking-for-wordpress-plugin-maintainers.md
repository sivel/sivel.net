As I have [announced][1], [announced][2], and [announced][3] again; I am ceasing development and support on several plugins. The list of those plugins was in the [interview][2] with me on [WPTavern][4], but I wanted to formally outline the plugins that have yet to find a new home, and announce, yes another announcement, that there is one more to be added to that list.

Plugins being sent to the plugin orphanage:

*   [<del>Moderate Selected Posts</del>][5] - New Owner to be Announced Soon
*   [<del>Display Name Author Permalink</del>][6] - New Owner to be Announced Soon
*   [Ajaxify FAQ-Tastic][7]
*   Ajax Feed Shortcode - Yet to be released

Everyone please take a look over the above plugins and if you think that you are interested and would like to take over ownership for one or several of these plugins please let me know, either through my contact form or in the comments here.
