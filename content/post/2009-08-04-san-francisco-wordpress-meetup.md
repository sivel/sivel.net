There will be a WordPress meetup held at the Automattic office at [Pier 38][1] on August 11. I'll be in San Francisco for the [OpenSourceWorld Expo][2] and will be attending the meetup. Numerous folks from Automattic should be there and there will be a demo of the GSoC project, currently called 'Elastic', which is the WYSIWYG theme designer. Mark the date on your calendars, I want to see you all there! The meetup should start around 6:30PM, feel free to show up a little early as I am sure there will be some folks there.
