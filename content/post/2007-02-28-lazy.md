At one point in my life I thought that I could design and up-keep a custom written web site and quickly found that I was too lazy to keep it up.

I then switched to Mediawiki to organize the content on my site and found myself too lazy to keep it updated.

I have now switched to WordPress to organize the content of my site. My hope is to not make available information which is easily found on sites with high search ratings.
