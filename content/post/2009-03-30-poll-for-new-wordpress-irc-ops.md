title: Poll for New OPs in WordPress IRC Channel Opened
type: post
---

Over the past few months to a year I have noticed a lack of OPs in the [WordPress IRC Channel][1]. In the recent days there have been several times when an OP was needed but no one had OP access. I brought this to the attention of [Matt Mullenweg][2] via email over the weekend with hopes of getting new OPs in the channel. It seems as though Matt has come through by setting up a poll at <http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/3e0fcdaf55f1baed/>.

For those of you who use the WordPress IRC channel, please help out by completing the survey and listing the users that you think would make good OPs in the channel.

I won't be shy, and will come straight out an say that I would be honored to be an OP in this channel. I spend a large majority of my time in this channel, probably amounting to over 40 hours a week, helping users as best I can. If you decide that I would make a good OP and want to include me in your poll, my IRC nick is **sivel**.
