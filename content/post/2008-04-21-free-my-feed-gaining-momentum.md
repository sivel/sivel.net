Since launching [FreeMyFeed][1] on April 14th the service has really begun to gain momentum.

On April 17th Free My Feed was featured on [http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/][2] and subsequently on [Lifehacker][3].

Since all of the publicity beginning on April 17th from the aforementioned sites as well as many others, FreeMyFeed has been used to free over 800 feeds and has served up these feeds over 7000 times.
