I'm in the middle of updating all of my WordPress plugins, excluding those that I have previously marked as end of life, for WordPress 2.6 compatibility.

The changes in 2.6 will not affect the large majority of WordPress users so the current versions should work without problem.

I hope to release all updated plugins at the same time. I'm not quite sure when that will happen so keep an eye out. I may have to leave Shadowbox JS off the list and release the update later seeing as though I have to get Shadowbox 2.0 into the this coming release.
