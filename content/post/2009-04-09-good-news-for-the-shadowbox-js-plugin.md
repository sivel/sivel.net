[Michael J. I. Jackson][1] has just recently released [Shadwobox][2] 3.0 beta. I have undertaken a huge rewrite of the plugin to both accommodate Shadowbox 3.0 and to make the plugin better overall. The rewrite is nearly complete and already in place on this site. There are many improvements and new features on their way with this new version so please stay tuned. One thing to make special note of, is that this plugin will drop PHP4 support and require PHP5.
