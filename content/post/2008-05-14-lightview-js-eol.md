I will no longer be updating the [Lightview JS][1] WordPress plugin with new versions of Lightview from [Nick Stakenburg][2] as the author has changed the licensing requiring users to purchase Lightview. As I DO NOT purchase software and frown upon authors who distribute their software freely and then decide to require licensing fees; this plugin is now end of life.
