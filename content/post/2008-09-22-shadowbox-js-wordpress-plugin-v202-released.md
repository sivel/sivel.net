The [Shadowbox JS][1] WordPress Plugin has been updated to version 2.0.2. New to this update is the automatic addition of the rel attribute to image links, including those generated by the [ gallery] shortcode. See the [Change Log][2] for all changes. Enjoy! UPDATE: I found a typo in a variable name that was causing issues. The plugin has now been updated to 2.0.2.1.
