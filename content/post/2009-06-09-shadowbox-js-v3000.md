The [Shadowbox JS][1] WordPress plugin has been updated to version 3.0.0.0. This is a large update to the plugin. The majority of the plugin has been rewritten to load only the minimal amount of code needed for either the admin or frontend. New to this release is Shadowbox 3.0b1, programmatic loading of Shadowbox only when needed, selection of which Shadowbox players to load. See the [change log][2] for a full list of changes.

There are several important things to take note of:

*   PHP 4 Support Dropped
*   Additional Skins Removed
*   Custom skinning now requires 2 filters, see the FAQ for more information
*   The FLV player is disabled by default requiring you to agree to the licensing of the JW FLV Player before it can be used

If you are upgrading from one of the beta releases of this plugin you should use the option to reset to defaults after updating.
