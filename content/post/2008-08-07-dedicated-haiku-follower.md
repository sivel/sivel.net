A few weeks ago I posted that I would be going out to the LinuxWorld Expo in San Francisco. Yesterday I made my appearance, and took the time to talk to the guys at Haiku for a good while. They seemed to get the idea that I flew out here just to see their booth...Perhaps I may have actually said that.

Anyway, they took a picture and claimed that it would be on the [Haiku website][1] by the following day (today). And not really to my surprise, but I'll say that I am, my picture is indeed there.

[Check it out][2]

See the section titled "Interest still strong".
