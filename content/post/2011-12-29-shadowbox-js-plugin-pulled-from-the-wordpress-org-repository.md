Update: The <a title="Shadowbox JS WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shadowbox-js" target="_blank">Shadowbox JS</a> plugin is back in the repo!

<del>I was notified on December 28, 2011 that a complaint was made to the WordPress.org plugins repository team that the Shadowbox JS plugin contained non-GPL code (shadowbox.js).  This is correct, and I have known about it for some time, and although I had permission from the author to include it in the plugin download, it still doesn't make it GPL.  Due to this, the plugin has been pulled from the WordPress.org Plugins Repository.</del>

<del>It will likely be some time until I can get it back into the repo, as it is going to require some pretty large updates to the plugin to make use of the WP_Filesystem class to ensure that I can have the plugin reliably download the shadowbox files and put them into place so that they can be used.</del>

<del>I could always strip shadowbox out of the plugin, and require users to download and upload manually, but the user experience of doing such would be horrid, and likely cause a lot of users to stop using the plugin.</del>

<del>In the mean time the plugin can be downloaded from <a href="http://dl.sivel.net/wordpress/plugin/shadowbox-js.3.0.3.9.zip">http://dl.sivel.net/wordpress/plugin/shadowbox-js.3.0.3.9.zip</a></del>

<del>If you wish to test out the upcoming version that is addressing the issue of including shadowbox.js to get it back into the repository, you can download it from <a href="http://dl.sivel.net/wordpress/plugin/shadowbox-js.3.0.3.10a.zip">http://dl.sivel.net/wordpress/plugin/shadowbox-js.3.0.3.10a.zip</a></del>
