This morning at GMT 03:39:23 a user from the future accessed a website running on one of the servers that I manage at work.

There was a date timestamp in the HTTP request of "Wed, 34 Apr 3119 26:46:54 GMT".

Not only does this prove that users from the future are browsing our sites but it also proves that some time in the future we will add extra days into the calendar and add extra hours into the day.

Apparently time travel is possible. Bravo Doc Brown.

I have a feeling that Apple is behind this. While there are numerous requests during that time period, one of those hits came from a browser using the Webkit rendering engine. And Apple has created a piece of software called "Time Machine". I think that the "Time Machine" software and the Webkit rendering engine are running a Delorean. Now to find out where they got their "Flux Capacitor" from. And plutonium...Damn these guys at Apple are serious.
