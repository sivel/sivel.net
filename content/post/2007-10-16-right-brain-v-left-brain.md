I normally try to not post news that I got off of a news site but in this event I just had to.

Article from:[<img border='none' src='/uploads/2007/10/h14_heraldsun.gif' alt='http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22556281-661,00.html' />][1]

**THE Right Brain vs Left Brain test ... do you see the dancer turning clockwise or anti-clockwise?  
**

![][2]

If clockwise, then you use more of the right side of the brain and vice versa.

Most of us would see the dancer turning anti-clockwise though you can try to focus and change the direction; see if you can do it.

**LEFT BRAIN FUNCTIONS**  
uses logic  
detail oriented  
facts rule  
words and language  
present and past  
math and science  
can comprehend  
knowing  
acknowledges  
order/pattern perception  
knows object name  
reality based  
forms strategies  
practical  
safe

**RIGHT BRAIN FUNCTIONS**  
uses feeling  
"big picture" oriented  
imagination rules  
symbols and images  
present and future  
philosophy & religion  
can "get it" (i.e. meaning)  
believes  
appreciates  
spatial perception  
knows object function  
fantasy based  
presents possibilities  
impetuous  
risk taking

This just absolutely freaks me out. I see the dancer spinning clockwise and anti-clockwise. It switches while I am watching. I apparently use both the right and left side of my brain equally.
