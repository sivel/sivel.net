With the release of Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and the high number of questions I have been fielding about [Shadowbox.js][1] not working under the newly released IE8; I figured I would work on a hack that would allow the [Shadowbox JS][2] plugin to work with IE8 until Michael J. I. Jackson releases a version that natively supports IE8. I intend on releasing an update to the Shadowbox JS plugin soon to include IE8 support. Stay tuned for the release.
