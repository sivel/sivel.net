The [Ajax Plugin Helper][1] has been updated to version 1.0.4. This plugin actually went through 3 updates in the past 8 hours or so. New to these updates are fixing duplicate update notice in WordPress 2.9, making sure Ajax Upgrade was not available for the Ajax Plugin Helper itself and adding a Finnish translation by Christian Hellbeg. See the [change log][2] for a full time line of changes.
