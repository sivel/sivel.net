I have a question for all of the users out there who are using the Shadowbox JS and Lightview JS WordPress plugins.

Would you prefer the plugin to automatically add the activator attributes to the links for Shadowbox and Lightview respectively, rather than having to manually add it to your links?

I am one of those people who believe that more flexibility is a better feature than ease of use by less typing.

With that being said I could see a situation where one would simply want to use Shadowbox or Lightview for all of their image links and where adding the activator attributes to the links would become tiresome.

Perhaps a good compromise would be to add functionality to either enable or disable global activation on image links? Perhaps making global activation the default would be beneficial?

I think I have already talked myself into adding this functionality but I would still like to hear some user feedback, so tell me what you think.
