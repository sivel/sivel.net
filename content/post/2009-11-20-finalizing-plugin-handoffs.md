title: Finalizing Plugin Handoffs

A month or so ago I began giving away plugins to other authors. I just wanted to take a moment to announce which of the remaining pluigns are going where.

Two plugins will be transferring to [Michael Torbert][1]:

*   [Moderate Selected Posts][2]
*   [Display Name Author Permalink][2]

Another plugin will be going [Andy Stratton][3]:

*   [Page Restrict][4]

As of now I am no longer supporting these plugins and requests for support should go to their new authors.

Thank you very much Andy and Michael for taking over development and supporting the community.

I am still finalizing details on the Ajaxify FAQ-Tastic plugin with another author. There should be an announcement for this plugin and author soon.
