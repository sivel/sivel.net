The [Shadowbox JS][1] WordPress plugin has been updated to version 2.0.4.1. New to this version is Internet Explorer 8 support by way of the X-UA-Compatible meta tag. This hack is disabled by default because...well...it is a hack. To enable IE8 support visit the Shadowbox JS settings page in the WordPress admin and set 'Internet Explorer 8 Hack' to 'true'. Enjoy!
